Here's what the above code is doing:
1."," We import the matplotlib.pyplot module and give it the alias plt.
2. We import the numpy module and give it the alias np.
3. We create a NumPy array called x that contains 100 evenly spaced values between -10 and 10.
4. We create a NumPy array called y that contains the values of the function f(x) = x + |x| for each value in x.
5. We call the plot() function to plot the points (x, y).
6. We call the show() function to display the plot.

The graph of the function is a line with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept of 0.",,"Q: Sketch the graph of the function. f(x) = x + |x|
A: Let's think step by step."," 

First, let's consider the function f(x) = x. The graph of this function is a line that goes through the origin and has a slope of 1. 

Now, let's consider the function f(x) = |x|. The graph of this function is a line that goes through the origin and has a slope of 1, but it is ""reflected"" about the y-axis. 

Putting these two functions together, we get a graph that is a line with a slope of 1 that goes through the origin, but is ""reflected"" about the y-axis whenever the input is negative.",,"[3, 2]"
