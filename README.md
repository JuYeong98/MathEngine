# A Neural Network Solves, Explains, and Generates University Math Problems by Program Synthesis and Few-Shot Learning at Human Level

## How to use this code:

## 1. In your terminal, type the following command:

**python3 embedding.py**

This will embed and save all of the questions from each course(embeddings.json) and create an image of the embeddings after they have had their         dimensionality reduced via UMAP(UMAP.png).

## 2. In your terminal, type the following command:

**python3 zero-shot.py**

**python3 few-shot.py**
