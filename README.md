A Neural Network Solves, Explains, and Generates University Math Problems by Program Synthesis and Few-Shot Learning at Human Level

To run use this code, do the following:

1.In your terminal, type the following:

** python3 embedding.py

This will embed and save all of the questions from each course(embeddings.json) and create an image of the embeddings after they have had their         dimensionality reduced via UMAP(UMAP.png).

** python3 zero-shot.py

** python3 few-shot.py
