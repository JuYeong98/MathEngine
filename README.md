# A Neural Network Solves, Explains, and Generates University Math Problems by Program Synthesis and Few-Shot Learning at Human Level

## How to use this code(make sure to have an OpenAI API key):

## 1. In your terminal, run: **python3 embedding.py**
This will embed and save all of the question embeddings from each course(embeddings.json) and create an image of the embeddings after they have had their         dimensionality reduced via UMAP(UMAP.png).
## 2. In your terminal, run: **python3 zero-shot.py**
explain what this step does here.
## 3. In each of the created CSV's, evaluate each generated program by doing the following: Under column "Codex: Correct or Incorrect?", put a 1 if the program is correct, and 0 otherwise.
explain what this step does here.
## 4. In your terminal, run: **python3 few-shot.py**
explain what this step does here.
