# A Neural Network Solves, Explains, and Generates University Math Problems by Program Synthesis and Few-Shot Learning at Human Level
This is the repository for [A Neural Network Solves, Explains, and Generates University Math Problems by Program Synthesis and Few-Shot Learning at Human Level by Iddo Drori et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.15594). It contains the paper and its supplementary materials (`paper`), jsons files for every question evaluated (`data`), and evaluation code used for generating figures and performing few-shot learning (`code`).
