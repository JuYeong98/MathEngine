       "Codex code explanation": "1. It's creating a class called UniformDistribution.\n2. It's creating a method called __init__ which is a special method that is called when you create an instance of the class.\n3. It's creating a method called pdf which is a probability density function.\n4. It's creating a method called cdf which is a cumulative density function.\n5. It's creating a method called ppf which is a percent point function.\n6. It's creating a method called rvs which is a random variate function.\n",
