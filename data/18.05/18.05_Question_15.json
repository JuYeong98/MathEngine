       "Original question": "Alice and Bob are trying to meet for lunch and both will arrive, independently of each other, uniformly and at random between noon and 1pm. Let A and B be the number of minutes after noon at which Alice and Bob arrive, respectively. Then A and B are independent uniformly distributed random variables on [0, 60]. Find the probability that Alice arrives before 12:30.",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef arrival_time(n):\n    return np.random.uniform(0, 60, n)\n\ndef before_1230(n):\n    return np.sum(arrival_time(n) < 30) / n\n\nprint(before_1230(100000))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. Generate a random number between 0 and 60\n2. If the number is less than 30, add 1 to the count\n3. Repeat this process n times\n4. Divide the count by n to get the probability",
       "Program solution": 0.5,
       "Solution type": "Automatic Zero-shot",
       "GPT-3 response": "The probability that Alice arrives before 12:30 is 0.5.",
       "GPT-3 evaluation": "Correct"
