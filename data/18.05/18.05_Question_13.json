       "Original question": "To head the newly formed US Dept. of Statistics, suppose that 50% of the population supports Erika, 20% supports Ruthi, and the rest are split between Peter, Jon and Jerry. A poll asks 400 random people who they support. Use the central limit theorem to estimate the probability that at least 52.5% of those polled prefer Erika?",
       "Codex input": "50% of the population supports Erika. A poll asks 400 random people who they support. Use the central limit theorem to estimate the probability that at least 52.5% of those polled prefer Erika?",
       "Codex code": "# The population proportion is 0.5\np = 0.5\n\n# The sample size is 400\nn = 400\n\n# The sample proportion is 0.525\np_hat = 0.525\n\n# The standard deviation of the sample proportion is\nsigma = np.sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)\n\n# The z-score is\nz = (p_hat - p) / sigma\n\n# The probability is\nprob = 1 - stats.norm.cdf(z)\n\nprint(prob)\n",

       "GPT-3 response": "The central limit theorem says that the distribution of the sample mean will be normal for large sample sizes. We can use this to find the probability that at least 52.5% of those polled prefer Erika.\n\nWe know that the mean of the distribution is 0.5 and the standard deviation is 0.2. We can use the z-score formula to find the z-score corresponding to 52.5%.\n\nz = (52.5% - 0.5) / 0.2\n\nz = 2.5\n\nThe probability that the poll will result in at least 52.5% of people preferring Erika is 0.9938.",
