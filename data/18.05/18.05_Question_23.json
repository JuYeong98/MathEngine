       "Original question": "Suppose \u03bc is the average height of a college male. You measure the heights (in inches) of twenty college men, getting data x1,...,x20, with sample mean x = 69.55 in. and sample 2 variance s = 14.26 in2. Suppose that the xi are drawn from a normal distribution with unknown mean \u03bc and unknown variance \u03c32. Now suppose you are told that the height of a college male is normally distributed with standard deviation 3.77 in. How many people in total would you need to measure to bring the width of the 90% z\u2013confidence interval down to 1 inch?",
       "Codex input": "A gaussian distribution has mean 69.55 and variance of 14.26. Calculate the stdev. Calculate the number of samples needed to make the 90% z-confidence interval 0.5. Square and round to the next highest number.",
       "Codex code": "import math\n\nmean = 69.55\nvariance = 14.26\n\nstdev = math.sqrt(variance)\n\nprint(stdev)\n\nz = 1.645\n\nn = (z**2 * variance) / (0.5**2)\n\nprint(math.ceil(n))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. Import the math module\n2. Set the mean and variance\n3. Calculate the standard deviation\n4. Calculate the number of samples needed to make the 90% z-confidence interval 0.5",
