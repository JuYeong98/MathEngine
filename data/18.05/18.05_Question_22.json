       "Original question": "You have a drawer that contains 50 coins. 10 coins have probability p = 0.3 of heads, 30 coins have probability p = 0.5 and 10 coins have probability p = 0.7. You pick one coin at random from the drawer and flip it. What are the (prior) odds you chose a 0.5 coin?",
       "Codex input": "You have a drawer that contains 50 coins. 10 coins have probability p = 0.3 of heads, 30 coins have probability p = 0.5 and 10 coins have probability p = 0.7. You pick one coin at random from the drawer and flip it. Print the odds you chose a 0.5 coin?",
       "Codex code": "# Solution\n\n# Probability of choosing a 0.5 coin\np_0_5 = 30/50",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We have a class called Coin.\n2. We have a constructor that takes in the probability of heads.\n3. We have a method called flip that returns a random number between 0 and 1. If the random number is less than the probability of heads, we return heads. Otherwise, we return tails.",
