       "Codex code explanation": "1. It's initializing the class with a parameter a.\n2. It's defining a method called sample which takes a parameter n and returns n samples from the uniform distribution.\n3. It's defining a method called log_likelihood which takes a parameter x and returns the log likelihood of x.",
