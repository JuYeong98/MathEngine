       "Original question": "At noon, the minute and the hour hands of an analog clock coincide. What is the angle (in degrees) subtended by the minute and hour hands of an analog clock at 1:15?",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "def angle(h, m):\n    h_angle = (h * 30) + (m * 0.5)\n    m_angle = m * 6\n    return abs(h_angle - m_angle)\n\nprint(angle(1, 15))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. The hour hand moves 30 degrees every hour.\n2. The minute hand moves 6 degrees every minute.\n3. The hour hand moves 0.5 degrees every minute.",
       "Program solution": "52.5",

       "GPT-3 response": "The angle between the minute and hour hands at 1:15 is 90 degrees.",
       "GPT-3 evaluation": "Incorrect"
