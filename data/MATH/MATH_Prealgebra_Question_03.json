The function gcd(a, b) is called with the arguments 84 and gcd(112, 210).\n3. The function gcd(a, b) is called with the arguments 112 and gcd(210, 112).\n4. The function gcd(a, b) is called with the arguments 210 and gcd(112, 98).\n5. The function gcd(a, b) is called with the arguments 112 and gcd(98, 14).\n6. The function gcd(a, b) is called with the arguments 98 and gcd(14, 0).",
