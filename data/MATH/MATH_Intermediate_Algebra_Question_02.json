       "Codex code explanation": "1. The objective function is defined as a function of x.\n2. The constraint is defined as a function of x.\n3. The initial guess is defined as a list of two numbers.\n4. The constraint is defined as a dictionary.\n5. The minimize function is called with the objective function, the initial guess, the method, and the constraint.\n6. The solution is printed.\n7. The solution is printed.\n8. The objective function is evaluated at the solution.",
