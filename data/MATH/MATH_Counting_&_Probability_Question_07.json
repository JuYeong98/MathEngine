       "Codex code explanation": "1. We import the math module.\n2. We define a function called combinations that takes two parameters: n and k.\n3. We return the number of possible combinations of k items from a set of n items.\n4. We call the combinations function with the arguments 7 and 2.\n5. We print the result.",
