       "Codex code explanation": "1. We start with 11/125.\n2. We divide 11 by 125 and get 0 as the quotient and 11 as the remainder.\n3. We multiply the remainder by 10 and get 110.\n4. We divide 110 by 125 and get 0 as the quotient and 110 as the remainder.\n5. We multiply the remainder by 10 and get 1100.\n6. We divide 1100 by 125 and get 8 as the quotient and 100 as the remainder.\n7. We multiply the remainder by 10 and get 1000.\n8. We divide 1000 by 125 and get 8 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder.\n9. We stop because the remainder is 0.",
