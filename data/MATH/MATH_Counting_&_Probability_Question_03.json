       "Original question": "The Rotokas of Papua New Guinea have twelve letters in their alphabet. The letters are: A, E, G, I, K, O, P, R, S, T, U, and V. Suppose license plates of five letters utilize only the letters in the Rotoka alphabet. How many license plates of five letters are possible that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat?",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "import itertools\n\ndef main():\n    letters = ['A', 'E', 'G', 'I', 'K', 'O', 'P', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V']\n    plates = itertools.permutations(letters, 5)\n    plates = [''.join(plate) for plate in plates]\n    plates = [plate for plate in plates if plate[0] in ['G', 'K'] and plate[-1] == 'T' and 'S' not in plate]\n    plates = [plate for plate in plates if len(set(plate)) == 5]\n    print(len(plates))\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. Create a list of all the letters in the alphabet.\n2. Create a list of all possible permutations of 5 letters.\n3. Convert the permutations from tuples to strings.\n4. Filter out the strings that don't start with G or K, don't end with T, and don't contain S.\n5. Filter out the strings that have repeating letters.\n6. Print the length of the list.",

       "GPT-3 response": "There are 60 possible license plates of five letters that begin with either G or K, end with T, cannot contain S, and have no letters that repeat.",
       "GPT-3 evaluation": "Incorrect"
