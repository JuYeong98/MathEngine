       "Codex code": "def main():\n    ans = 1\n    for i in range(1, 4):\n        ans *= i\n    return ans % 5\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(main())",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. It's creating a variable called ans and setting it equal to 1.\n2. It's creating a for loop that iterates through the numbers 1, 2, and 3.\n3. It's multiplying the value of ans by i and setting ans equal to the result.\n4. It's returning the value of ans modulo 5.\n\nThe above code is equivalent to the following:\n\nans = 1\nans = ans * 1\nans = ans * 2\nans = ans * 3\nreturn ans % 5",
