       "Original question": "The 5 a.m. temperatures for seven consecutive days were -7 degrees, -4 degrees, -4 degrees, -5 degrees, 1 degree, 3 degrees and 2 degrees Celsius. What is the mean 5 a.m. temperature for the week in degrees Celsius?",
       "Codex input": "The 5 a.m. temperatures for seven consecutive days were -7 degrees, -4 degrees, -4 degrees, -5 degrees, 1 degree, 3 degrees and 2 degrees Celsius. Write a program that finds the mean 5 a.m. temperature for the week in degrees Celsius.",
       "Codex code": "temps = [-7, -4, -4, -5, 1, 3, 2]\n\nmean = sum(temps) / len(temps)\n\nprint(mean)",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We create a list of temperatures.\n2. We use the sum() function to add up all the temperatures in the list.\n3. We use the len() function to count the number of temperatures in the list.\n4. We divide the sum of the temperatures by the number of temperatures to find the mean.\n5. We print the mean.",
