       "Codex code explanation": "1. We import sympy and math.\n2. We create a variable x and set it equal to sympy.symbols('x'). This is how we tell sympy that we want to use x as a variable.\n3. We create two variables, y1 and y2, and set them equal to sympy.tan(x)**2 and sympy.sqrt(x), respectively.\n4. We create a variable called intersection_points and set it equal to sympy.solve(y1 - y2). This is how we tell sympy to find the intersection points of the two curves.\n5. We create a variable called area and set it equal to sympy.integrate(y1 - y2, (x, intersection_points[0], intersection_points[1])). This is how we tell sympy to find the area between the two curves.\n6. We print the area.",
