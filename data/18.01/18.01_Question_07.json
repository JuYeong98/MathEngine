       "Codex code explanation": "1. We are finding the limit of csc(x)*sin(sin(x)) as x approaches 0.\n2. We are using the limit function from the sympy library.\n3. We are passing in the function csc(x)*sin(sin(x)) as the first argument.\n4. We are passing in the variable x as the second argument.\n5. We are passing in the number 0 as the third argument.",
