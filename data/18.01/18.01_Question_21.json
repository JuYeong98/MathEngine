       "GPT-3 response": "A curve is defined by a set of parametric equations if the coordinates of each point on the curve are given by specific functions of a variable. The variable is called a parameter.\n\nThe parametric equations for a curve are usually written as x = f(t) and y = g(t). The parameter t is usually restricted to a certain interval, such as 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1.\n\nThe graph of the parametric equations x = f(t) and y = g(t) is the set of points (f(t), g(t)) for all values of t in the interval.\n\nExample 1: Find the graph of the parametric equations x = t2 and y = t3.\n\nSolution: The graph of the parametric equations x = t2 and y = t3 is the set of points (t2, t3) for all values of t.",
