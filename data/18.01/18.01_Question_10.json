       "Original question": "The water level, measured in feet above mean sea level, of Lake Lanier in Georgia, USA, during 2012 can be modeled by the function L(t)=0.01441*t**3-0.4177*t**2+2.703*t+1060.1. Find the time t between 0 and 12 when the water level was maximum.",

We define a function that uses Newton's method to find the root of a function f(x)\n5. We print the result of using Newton's method to find the root of the derivative of L(t)\n",
