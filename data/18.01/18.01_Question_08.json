       "Codex input": "Write a program. The half-life of cesium-137 is 30 years. Suppose we have a 100-mg sample. How much of the sample remains after 100 years?",
       "Codex code": "import math\n\ndef half_life(t, h):\n    return 100 * math.pow(0.5, t/h)\n\nprint(half_life(100, 30))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We import the math module.\n2. We define a function called half_life that takes two arguments: t and h.\n3. We return the value of 100 * 0.5^(t/h).\n4. We print the result of half_life(100, 30).",
