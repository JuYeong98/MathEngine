       "Original question": "A force of 10 lb is required to hold a spring stretched 4 in. beyond its natural length. How much work is done in stretching it from its natural length to 6 in. beyond its natural length?",
       "Codex input": "A force of 10 lb is required to hold a spring stretched delta_x = 1/3 foot. Write a function to calculate the work done in stretching it to delta_x = 1/2 foot. Use Hooke's Law F = k*delta_x where delta_x is a sympy.symbols to find the spring constant k = 10/(1/3) and integrate F with respect to delta_x from 0 to the stretched ratio 1/2. Use sympy for the integral. Then plug in for delta_x = 1/2.",
       "Codex code": "import sympy\n\ndef work_done(delta_x):\n    k = 10/(1/3)\n    F = k*delta_x\n    return sympy.integrate(F, (delta_x, 0, 1/2))\n\nprint(work_done(sympy.symbols('delta_x')))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define a function called work_done that takes a variable delta_x as an argument.\n2. We define the spring constant k = 10/(1/3)\n3. We define the force F = k*delta_x\n4. We return the integral of F with respect to delta_x from 0 to 1/2.\n5. We print the result of calling work_done with sympy.symbols('delta_x') as the argument.",
