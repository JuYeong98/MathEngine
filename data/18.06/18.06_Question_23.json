       "Program solution": "If we add 1/3 to 1/7\n(fraction of integers divisible by 3 plus fraction divisible by 7) we\nhave double counted the integers divisible by both 3 and 7. This is a fraction 1/21 of all\nintegers (because these double counted numbers are multiples of 21). So the fraction\ndivisible by 3 or 7 or both is\n1/3+1/7\u22121/21=7/21+3/21\u22121/21=9/21=3/7",
