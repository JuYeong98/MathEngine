       "Original question": "Find general solutions of the differential equations. If an initial condition is given, find the corresponding particular solution. Throughout, primes denote derivatives with respect to x. y' + y = 2, y(0) = 0",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "from sympy import Function, dsolve, Eq, Derivative, sin, cos, symbols\nfrom sympy.abc import x\n\nf = Function('f')\n\neq = Eq(f(x).diff(x) + f(x), 2)\n\nsol = dsolve(eq)\n\nprint(sol)\n\neq1 = Eq(f(x).diff(x) + f(x), 2)\n\nsol1 = dsolve(eq1, f(x), ics={f(0): 0})\n\nprint(sol1)",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define a function f(x)\n2. We define the differential equation\n3. We solve the differential equation\n4. We define the differential equation again, but this time we also define the initial condition\n5. We solve the differential equation with the initial condition",
       "Program solution": "y(x) = 2(1-e^-x)",
