       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "import sympy as sp\n\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\ny = sp.Function('y')\n\n# dy/dx=2x+1\neq = sp.Eq(y(x).diff(x), 2*x+1)\n\n# y(0)=3\nics = {y(0): 3}\n\n# Solve the differential equation\nsol = sp.dsolve(eq, ics=ics)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(sol)",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We import the sympy module and rename it as sp.\n2. We create a symbol x and a function y.\n3. We create an equation dy/dx=2x+1.\n4. We create an initial condition y(0)=3.\n5. We solve the differential equation using the dsolve() function.\n6. We print the solution.",
