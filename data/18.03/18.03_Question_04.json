       "Original question": "Separate variables and use partial fractions to solve the initial value problems. Use either the exact solution or a computer-generated slope field to sketch the graphs of several solutions of the given differential equation, and highlight the indicated particular solution. f'(x)=3*f(x)(5-f(x)), f(0)=8",
