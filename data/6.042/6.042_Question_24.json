       "Original question": "Find the coefficients of x^10 in (x + (1/x))^100",
       "Codex input": "Using sympy, find the coefficients of x^10 in (x + (1/x))^100",
       "Codex code": "from sympy import symbols, expand\n\nx = symbols('x')\n\nprint(expand((x + (1/x))**100).coeff(x, 10))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. The code is using the expand function to expand the expression (x + (1/x))**100\n2. The expand function is then used to find the coefficient of x**10",
