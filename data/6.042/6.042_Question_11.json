       "Original question": "Scores for a final exam are given by picking an integer uniformly at random from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}. The scores of all 128 students in the class are assigned independently in this manner. Let S be the average of their scores. Find Var(S).",
       "Codex input": "Write a function that uniformly samples 128 scores from {50,52 ... 98} and finds the mean of that sample. \nThen write a function that loops 100000 times and finds np.var of the samples.",
       "Codex code": "def sample_mean(n):\n    return np.mean(np.random.choice(range(50,99), n))\n\ndef sample_var(n):\n    return np.var([sample_mean(n) for i in range(100000)])\n\nprint(sample_var(128))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. sample_mean(n) returns the mean of n random integers between 50 and 98.\n2. sample_var(n) returns the variance of 100000 sample means of n random integers between 50 and 98.",
