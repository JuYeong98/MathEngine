       "Original question": "Scores for a final exam are given by picking an integer uniformly at random from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}. The scores of all 128 students in the class are assigned in this manner. Let S1, . . . , S128 be their scores. For i \u2208 {1, . . . , 128}, what is E[Si] ? ",
       "Codex input": "Scores for a final exam are given by picking an integer uniformly at random from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}. \nThe scores of 128 students in a class are assigned in this manner. Write a program to compute the mean score?",
       "Codex code": "import random\n\ndef mean(n):\n    sum = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        sum += random.randint(50, 98)\n    return sum/n\n\nprint(mean(128))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. It's creating a function called mean that takes in a parameter n.\n2. It's creating a variable called sum and setting it equal to 0.\n3. It's creating a for loop that iterates n times.\n4. It's adding a random integer between 50 and 98 to the sum variable.\n5. It's returning the sum divided by n.\n6. It's calling the mean function with 128 as the parameter.\n7. It's printing the result.",
