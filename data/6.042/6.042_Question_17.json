       "Original question": "Suppose the 6.042 final consists of: 36 true/false questions worth 1 point each, 1 induction problem worth 15 points, and 1 giant problem that combines everything from the semester, worth 49 points. Grading goes as follows: The TAs choose to grade the easy true/false questions. For each individual point, they flip a fair coin. If it comes up heads, the student gets the point. Marten and Brooke split the task of grading the induction problem. With 1/3 probability, Marten grades the problem. His grading policy is as follows: Either he gets exasperated by the improper use of math symbols and gives 0 points (which happens with 2/5 probability), or he finds the answer satisfactory and gives 15 points (which happens with 3/5 probability). With 2/3 probability, Brooke grades the problem. Her grading policy is as follows: She selects a random integer point value from the range from 0 to 15, inclusive, with uniform probability. Finally, Tom grades the giant problem. He rolls two fair seven-sided dice (which have values from 1 to 7, inclusive), takes their product, and subtracts it from 49 to determine the score. Assume all random choices during the grading process are mutually independent. What is the variance on the 36 true/false questions?",
