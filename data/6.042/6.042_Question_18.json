If one of these three has both an opportunity and the revolver, then that person\nshoots Colonel Mustard. Otherwise, Colonel Mustard escapes. Exactly one of the three\nhas an opportunity with the following probabilities:\nPr {Plum has opportunity} = 1/6\nPr {Green has opportunity} = 2/6\nPr {Scarlet has opportunity} = 3/6\nExactly one has the revolver with the following probabilities, regardless of who has an\nopportuntity:\nPr {Plum has revolver} = 4/8\nPr {Green has revolver} = 3/8\nPr {Scarlet has revolver} = 1/8 \nWhat is the probability that Colonel Mustard is shot?",
