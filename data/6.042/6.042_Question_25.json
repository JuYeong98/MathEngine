       "Codex input": "To define a bijection between natural number and integers, map the even and odd natural numbers to positive and negative integers. Divide by 2 and rounding down.",
       "Codex code": "def even_odd_to_int(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        return n // 2\n    else:\n        return -(n + 1) // 2",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. If n is even, then n // 2 is the integer division of n by 2.\n2. If n is odd, then -(n + 1) // 2 is the integer division of -(n + 1) by 2.\n3. The integer division of -(n + 1) by 2 is the same as the integer division of -n by 2, because -(n + 1) = -n - 1.\n4. The integer division of -n by 2 is the same as the integer division of n by 2, because -n = -1 * n.\n5. So, if n is odd, then -(n + 1) // 2 is the same as n // 2.",
