       "Original question": "Scores for a final exam are given by picking an integer uniformly at random from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}. The scores of all 128 students in the class are assigned independently in this manner. Let S1, . . . , S128 be their scores. Find Var(Si).",
       "Codex input": "Scores for a final exam are given by picking an integer uniformly at random from the set {50, 51, . . . , 97, 98}. \nThe scores of 128 students in a class are assigned independently in this manner. Write a program to compute the variance of the score.",

       "GPT-3 response": "# We can use the fact that the variance of a uniform distribution is 1/12.\n# So the variance of each student's score is 1/12.\n# So the variance of the sum of the scores is 128*1/12 = 16.",
