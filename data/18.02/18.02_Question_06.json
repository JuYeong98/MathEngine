       "Original question": "Find the arc length of the given curve. x = 2t, y = 2/3*t^(3/2), 5<=t<=12",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "import sympy as sp\n\nt = sp.Symbol('t')\nx = 2*t\ny = 2/3*t**(3/2)\n\ndx = sp.diff(x, t)\ndy = sp.diff(y, t)\n\nds = sp.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)\n\nprint(sp.integrate(ds, (t, 5, 12)))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. Define x and y as functions of t\n2. Define dx and dy as the derivatives of x and y with respect to t\n3. Define ds as the magnitude of dx and dy\n4. Integrate ds from 5 to 12",
