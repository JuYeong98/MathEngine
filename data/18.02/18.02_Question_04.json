       "Original question": "Find the area bounded by the given curve. r = 2*cos(theta)",
       "Codex input": "f(theta)=2*cos(theta)\nUsing Sympy, starting from 0, find the first two points that f(theta)=0 and set teh solutions to a and b.\nUse the solution to Integrate f(theta)**2/2 from a to b.",

       "Codex code explanation": "1. The first line imports the sympy library.\n2. The second line defines the function f(theta) as 2*cos(theta).\n3. The third line defines the symbol theta.\n4. The fourth line uses the solve() function to find the two values of theta that make f(theta)=0.\n5. The fifth line uses the integrate() function to find the area under the curve from a to b.",
