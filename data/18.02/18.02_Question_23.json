The parametric equations of a line are:\n    x = x_1 + t*(x_2 - x_1)\n    y = y_1 + t*(y_2 - y_1)\n    z = z_1 + t*(z_2 - z_1)\n3. We are using the points P_1 and P_2 to find the coordinates of a point on the line.\n4. We are using the symbols x, y, z to represent the coordinates of the point on the line.\n5. We are using the symbol t to represent the parameter.\n6. We are using the Matrix class to represent the coordinates of the points P_1 and P_2.\n7. We are using the Matrix class to represent the coordinates of the point on the line.\n8. We are using the Matrix class to represent the parametric equations of the line.",
