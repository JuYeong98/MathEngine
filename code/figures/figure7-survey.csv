The power absorbed by the bulb when it is operated at full current is I1 P1, at high current is I2 P2, at low current is I3 P3, and when the bulb is unplugged I4 P4. During unknown time t, the voltage available to the battery is E applies. I1 / (R1 + RL), I2 / (R2 + RL), I3 / (R3 + RL), I4 / (R4 + RL) where R1 = 4 Ohm and R2 = 4 Ohm. In addition the battery voltage is v, at time t.
