       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define a function roll_dice() that returns a random integer between 1 and 6.\n2. We define a function roll_all_dice() that returns a list of five random integers between 1 and 6.\n3. We define a function all_different() that takes a list of integers and returns True if all the integers are different and False otherwise.\n4. We define a function main() that does the following:\n    a. It sets n_trials to 100000.\n    b. It sets n_success to 0.\n    c. It loops n_trials times, each time doing the following:\n        i. It rolls all five dice.\n        ii. If all five dice show different values, it increments n_success by 1.\n    d. It prints the fraction of trials that were successful.\n5. We call main().",
