A person selected uniformly at random has finalphobia with probability 1/100. A person with finalphobia has shaky hands with probability 9/10.

       "Codex code explanation": "1. We are given the probability of having finalphobia, p_f, and the probability of having shaky hands, p_s.\n2. We are also given the probability of not having finalphobia, 1 - p_f, and the probability of having shaky hands, p_n.\n3. We want to find the probability of having finalphobia, given that we have shaky hands.\n4. We can use Bayes' Theorem to find this probability.\n5. Bayes' Theorem states that P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B).\n6. We can use this to find the probability of having finalphobia, given that we have shaky hands.\n7. We can find P(B) by adding the probabilities of having shaky hands, given that we have finalphobia and given that we don't have finalphobia.\n8. We can then plug these values into Bayes' Theorem to find the probability of having finalphobia, given that we have shaky hands.",
