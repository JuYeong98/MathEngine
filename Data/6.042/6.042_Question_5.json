       "Original question": "MIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days. Assume all random values described below are mutually independent. A busy student must complete 3 problem sets before doing laundry. Each problem set requires 1 day with probability 2/3 and 2 days with probability 1/3. Let B be the number of days a busy student delays laundry. What is Ex (B)?  ",
       "Codex input": "MIT students sometimes delay laundry for a few days. Assume all random values described below are mutually independent. Days for illness recovery is u=a*b where a and b are independent dice rolls. What's the expected value of u? ",
       "Codex code": "import numpy as np\n\na = np.random.randint(1,7,size=100000)\nb = np.random.randint(1,7,size=100000)\n\nu = a*b\n\nprint(np.mean(u))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. Generate 100000 random numbers between 1 and 6.\n2. Multiply each of these numbers by another 100000 random numbers between 1 and 6.\n3. Take the mean of the resulting 100000 numbers.",

       "GPT-3 response": "# Let X be the number of days a problem set takes to complete.\n# Then, X ~ Bernoulli(2/3)\n# Let B be the number of days a busy student delays laundry.\n# Then, B = X + Y + Z, where X, Y, and Z are independent and identically distributed.\n# Therefore, B ~ Binomial(3, 2/3)\n# Ex(B) = 3(2/3) = 2",
