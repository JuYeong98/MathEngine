       "Original question": "Outside of their hum\u00addrum duties as 6.042 TAs, Sayan is trying to learn to levitate using only intense concentration and Jelani is launching a \u201cNelson 2008\u201d presidential campaign. Suppose that Sayan\u2019s probability of levitating is 1/6, Jelani\u2019s chance of becoming president is 1/4, and the success of one does not alter the other\u2019s chances. If at most one of them succeeds, what is the probability that Jelani becomes the president of the United States?",
       "Codex input": "Suppose that Sayan\u2019s probability Sayan succeeding is 1/6, and Jelani's probability of succeeding is 1/4. Use numpy to find the probability at most one of Jelani and Sayan succeed.\nUse numpy to find the probability Jelani succeeds but Sayan does not succeed.\nDivide the former by the latter probability.",
       "Codex code": "import numpy as np\n\n# Probability of Sayan succeeding\np_sayan = 1/6\n\n# Probability of Jelani succeeding\np_jelani = 1/4\n\n# Probability of at most one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding\np_at_most_one = 1 - (p_sayan * p_jelani)\n\n# Probability of Jelani succeeding but Sayan not succeeding\np_jelani_succeed_sayan_not = p_jelani * (1 - p_sayan)\n\n# Probability of Jelani succeeding but Sayan not succeeding divided by probability of at most one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding\np_jelani_succeed_sayan_not / p_at_most_one\n\n# Probability of at least one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding\np_at_least_one = 1 - p_at_most_one\n",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We're calculating the probability of Sayan succeeding.\n2. We're calculating the probability of Jelani succeeding.\n3. We're calculating the probability of at most one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding.\n4. We're calculating the probability of Jelani succeeding but Sayan not succeeding.\n5. We're calculating the probability of Jelani succeeding but Sayan not succeeding divided by probability of at most one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding.\n6. We're calculating the probability of at least one of Jelani and Sayan succeeding.",
