       "Course": "Single Variable Calculus",

       "Original question": "The radius of a sphere is increasing at a rate of 4 mm/s. How fast is the volume increasing when the diameter is 80 mm?",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "import sympy as sp\n\nr = sp.symbols('r')\n\nd = 4*r\n\nv = 4/3*sp.pi*r**3\n\ndv_dr = sp.diff(v,r)\n\nprint(dv_dr.subs(r,80))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define the radius as a symbol.\n2. We define the diameter as a function of the radius.\n3. We define the volume as a function of the radius.\n4. We take the derivative of the volume with respect to the radius.\n5. We substitute the radius with 80 and print the result.",
       "Program solution": "25600*pi",
       "Solution type": "Manual",
       "GPT-3 response": "The volume of a sphere is increasing at a rate of approximately 201.06 mm3/s.",
       "GPT-3 evaluation": "Incorrect"
