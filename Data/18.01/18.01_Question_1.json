       "Codex code explanation": "1. We import the numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries.\n2. We create an array of 100 evenly spaced numbers from -10 to 10.\n3. We create an array of the same size as x, where each element is the absolute value of the corresponding element in x.\n4. We plot the graph of y against x.\n5. We label the x-axis and y-axis.\n6. We display the grid.\n7. We display the graph.",
