       "Original question": "A homogeneous second-order linear differential equation, two functions y1 and y2, and a pair of initial conditions are given. First verify that y1 and y2 are solutions of the differential equation. Then find a particular solution of the form y=c1*y1+c2*y2 that satisfies the given initial conditions. Primes denote derivatives with respect to x. y''+4y=0; y1=cos2x, y2=sin2x; y(0)=3,  y'(0)=8",
       "Codex input": "A differential equation is f''(x)+4*f(x)=0.\nLet y1=cos(2*x) and y2=sin(2*x).\nUsing Sympy, show that f(x)=c1*y1+c2*y2 is the solution.\nSubstitute initial conditions f(0)=3 and f'(0)=8 to find C1 and C2.",
