       "Original question": "If v+w = (5,1) and v-w=(1,5), compute and draw the vectors v and w",
       "Codex input": "Given v+w = (5,1) and v-w=(1,5).\nWrite a program to compute v and w.",

       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define a function called main()\n2. We define two tuples called v and w\n3. We define two more tuples called v_plus_w and v_minus_w\n4. We print the values of v_plus_w and v_minus_w\n5. We call the main() function",
