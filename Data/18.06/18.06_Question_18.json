       "Program solution": "det(A \u2212 \u03bbI) = d\n2 \u2212 1.4\u03bb + 0.4 so A has \u03bb1 = 1 and \u03bb2 = 0.4 with x1 = (-.447, -.8944) and\nx2 = (-.7071, .7071). A\u221e has \u03bb1 = 1 and \u03bb2 = 0 (same eigenvectors). A100 has \u03bb1 = 1 and\n\u03bb2 = (0.4)100 which is near zero. So A100 is very near A\u221e: same eigenvectors and\nclose eigenvalues.",
