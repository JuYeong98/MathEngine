       "Original question": "What is the distance between (-2,4) and (3,-8)?",
       "Codex input": "Write a program that finds the distance between (-2,4) and (3,-8).\nPlot the points and the line between them",
       "Codex code": "import math\n\ndef distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):\n    return math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)\n\nprint(distance(-2, 4, 3, -8))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We define a function called distance that takes four parameters: x1, y1, x2, and y2.\n2. We return the distance between the two points using the distance formula.\n3. We call the function with the coordinates of two points and print the result.",
