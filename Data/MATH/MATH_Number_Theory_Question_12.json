       "Original question": "What is the smallest whole number b such that 62 can be expressed in base b using only three digits?",
       "Codex input": "Write a program to finds what is the smallest whole number b such that 62 can be expressed in base b using only three digits?",
       "Codex code": "def smallest_base(n):\n    for i in range(2, n):\n        if n < i**3:\n            return i\n\nprint(smallest_base(62))",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We start with the smallest possible base, which is 2.\n2. We check if 62 can be expressed in base 2 using only three digits.\n3. If it can, we return 2.\n4. If it can't, we increment the base by 1 and repeat the process.\n5. We keep doing this until we find the smallest base that can express 62 using only three digits.",

       "GPT-3 response": "The smallest whole number b such that 62 can be expressed in base b using only three digits is 7.",
