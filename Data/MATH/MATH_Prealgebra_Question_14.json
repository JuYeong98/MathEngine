       "Original question": "The average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years. If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old, how many years old is the oldest child?",
       "Codex input": "Same as original question",
       "Codex code": "# The average age of the three Wilson children is 7 years.\n# If the two younger children are 4 years old and 7 years old,\n# how many years old is the oldest child?\n\n# Let x be the age of the oldest child\n# 4 + 7 + x = 7 * 3\n# x = 7 * 3 - 4 - 7\n# x = 7 * 3 - 11\n# x = 14\n\nprint(7 * 3 - 11)",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We are creating a variable called x and assigning it the value of the oldest child's age.\n2. We are adding the ages of the two younger children and the oldest child.\n3. We are multiplying the average age by the number of children.\n4. We are subtracting the ages of the two younger children from the average age multiplied by the number of children.\n5. We are printing the value of the oldest child's age.",
