       "Original question": "What is the x-intercept of the line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 with y-intercept is 2.",
       "Codex input": "What is the x-intercept of the line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 with y-intercept is 2.\n",
       "Codex code": "# Solution\n# \n# > The line perpendicular to 3x-2y = 6 with y-intercept is 2 is 2x+3y = 3.\n# \n# > The x-intercept is when y = 0, which is x = 3.",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We're creating a variable called x_intercept and setting it equal to the x-intercept of the line.\n2. We're creating a variable called y_intercept and setting it equal to the y-intercept of the line.\n3. We're creating a variable called slope and setting it equal to the slope of the line.\n4. We're creating a variable called line and setting it equal to the equation of the line.\n5. We're creating a variable called perpendicular_line and setting it equal to the equation of the line perpendicular to the original line.\n6. We're creating a variable called x_intercept_perpendicular and setting it equal to the x-intercept of the perpendicular line.",
