       "Codex code explanation": "1. The sum() function takes a list as an argument and returns the sum of the elements in the list.\n2. The range() function takes a start, stop, and step as arguments and returns a list of numbers from start to stop,\n   incrementing by step.\n3. The sum_even_numbers() function takes a number n as an argument and returns the sum of the even numbers from 0 to n.\n4. The sum_even_numbers() function is called with the argument 62.",
