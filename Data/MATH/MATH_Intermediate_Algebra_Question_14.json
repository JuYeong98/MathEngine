       "Original question": "A sequence consists of 2010 terms.  Each term after the first is 1 larger than the previous term.  The sum of the 2010 terms is 5307.  When every second term is added up, starting with the first term and ending with the second last term, what is the sum?",
       "Codex input": "Declare variable i, n. sum_{i=0}^{2009} n + i = 5307. Sum().doit(), then solve. Using Sympy, find n and store in variable a. Cast a to a float.\n\nUsing a for loop, find the sum of a+i from i=0 until 2009 inclusive incrementing by 2.",
       "Codex code": "i = Symbol('i')\nn = Symbol('n')\n\na = solve(Sum(n+i, (i, 0, 2009)).doit() - 5307, n)[0]\na = float(a)\n\nb = 0\nfor i in range(0, 2010, 2):\n    b += a + i\n\nprint(b)",
       "Codex code explanation": "1. We are using the Sum function to sum up the series of numbers from 0 to 2009.\n2. We are using the doit() function to evaluate the sum.\n3. We are using the solve() function to solve the equation for n.\n4. We are converting the solution to a float.\n5. We are using a for loop to sum up the series of numbers from 0 to 2009, skipping every other number.\n6. We are printing the result.",
