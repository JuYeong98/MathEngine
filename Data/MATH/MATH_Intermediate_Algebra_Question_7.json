       "Codex code explanation": "1. The objective function is defined as the product of x1 and x2.\n2. The constraint is defined as 4*x1 + 9*x2 <= 60.\n3. The bounds are defined as 1 <= x1 <= 5 and 1 <= x2 <= 5.\n4. The initial guess is x1 = 1 and x2 = 1.\n5. The minimize function is used to minimize the objective function subject to the constraint and bounds.\n6. The solution is printed.\n7. The product of the solution is printed.",
